# LwCompatibilityLayer

Class stubs to fix dependency issues of open sourced Lifeware packages

Don't manually load this project! It's automatically loaded as dependency

## Why a compatibility layer?

To make open-sourced Lifeware code compatible with outside world there were 2 possibilities:
1. Change source code locally before comitting to remove closed-source dependencies
2. Have a compatibility layer as dependency

For now we're using solution 2 because it's more simple to maintain
